# Async_await-Func

  Async funtion In JS:
                The async function declaration creates a binding of a new async function to a given name.
                The await keyword is permitted within the function body, enabling asynchronous, 
                promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style and avoiding the need to
                explicitly configure promise chains.
            
Await:
        await enables the use of ordinary try / catch blocks around asynchronous code.
